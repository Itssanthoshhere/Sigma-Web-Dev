# 🌐 Day 1: Introduction to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Welcome to **Day 1** of my **Web Development Learning Journey**! 🚀  
In this first day, I explored the foundational concepts of **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, the three core technologies for web development. Here's a quick breakdown of what I learned and how I've structured my repository.

## 📂 Project Structure

- **index.html**: The main HTML file that structures the content of the web page.
- **style.css**: The CSS file that styles the page, making it visually appealing.
- **script.js**: The JavaScript file that adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to the webpage.

## 🔥 HTML (HyperText Markup Language)

HTML provides the skeleton for a webpage. In this simple page:
- I created headers and paragraphs to structure the content.
- Included a `<link>` to the external **CSS** file and a `<script>` tag to include **JavaScript**.

**Example:**
```html
<h1> Welcome to Sigma Web Dev! </h1>
<p> HTML structures the content of a webpage. </p>
```

## 🎨 CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

CSS adds the style and presentation to the web page. It changes how HTML elements appear on the page.

For example, in **style.css**, I've:
- Set the background color to **red**.
- Set the text color to **white** for contrast.

**Example:**
```css
body {
    background-color: red;
    color: white;
}
```

## ⚡ JavaScript

JavaScript adds interactivity to the web page. I’ve included a simple script that shows an alert message when the page loads.

**Example:**
```javascript
alert("Welcome to Sigma Web Dev");
```

## 🛠 How to Run the Project

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Itssanthoshhere/Sigma-Web-Dev.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the **Day 1** directory:
   ```bash
   cd Sigma-Web-Dev/Web\ Dev-learning-journey/Day\ 1\ -\ Introduction\ to\ HTML,\ CSS,\ and\ JavaScript
   ```
3. Open the `index.html` file in your favorite web browser to see the webpage in action.

## 📚 What I Learned

- **HTML** provides the structure for web pages.
- **CSS** is used to style and layout web pages.
- **JavaScript** brings interactivity and dynamic elements to web pages.
  
This project is a simple combination of these three technologies to build a basic webpage. I’ll be building upon these concepts in the following days as I dive deeper into web development.
