# Day 2: Basic Structure of an HTML Website

Welcome to **Day 2** of my web development journey! 🎯 Today, I focused on the **basic structure** of an HTML document, laying the groundwork for building more complex and interactive web pages.

---

## 🌐 Overview
The basic structure of every HTML document follows a clear, standard layout that provides a foundation for all web pages. Understanding this structure is key to ensuring your pages load correctly and work efficiently across all browsers.

### 🛠 Key Components:
- **DOCTYPE Declaration**: Specifies the version of HTML (HTML5 in this case).
- **`html` Tag**: Encloses all the HTML content.
- **`head` Tag**: Contains meta information like character encoding, viewport settings, title, and links to external resources (e.g., stylesheets).
- **`body` Tag**: Houses the visible content on the webpage.

├── index.html         # Basic HTML document structure
├── style.css          # Stylesheet linked to the HTML document (currently empty)
└── README.md          # Project documentation
```

## 📝 HTML Example

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <meta name="description" content="">
    <title>Title of the Page</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>
    content
</body>
</html>
```

## 🔍 Key Learnings

1. **DOCTYPE Declaration** informs the browser to interpret the document as HTML5.
2. The **`head` section** holds essential meta information, which improves SEO and ensures proper rendering.
3. The **`body` section** is where all visible content (text, images, videos, etc.) resides.
